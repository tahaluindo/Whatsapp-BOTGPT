# Getting Started with WhatsApp Cloud API

## Introduction

Welcome to the WhatsApp API from Meta.

Individual developers and existing Business Service Providers (BSPs) can now send and receive messages via the WhatsApp API using a cloud-hosted version of the WhatsApp Business API. Compared to the previous solutions, the cloud-based WhatsApp API is simpler to use and is a more cost-effective way for businesses to use WhatsApp. Please keep in mind the following configurations:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Version | Latest [Graph API version](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/). For example: v13.0 |
| User-Access-Token | Your user access token after signing up at [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com). |
| WABA-ID | Your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) ID. |
| Phone-Number-ID | ID for the phone number connected to the WhatsApp Business API. You can get this with a [Get Phone Number ID request](3184f675-d289-46f1-88e5-e2b11549c418). |
| Business-ID | Your Business' ID. Once you have your Phone-Number-ID, make a [Get Business Profile request](#99fd3743-46cf-46c4-95b5-431c6a4eb0b0) to get your Business' ID. |
| Recipient-Phone-Number | Phone number that you want to send a WhatsApp message to. |
| Media-ID | ID for the media to [send a media message](#0a632754-3788-43bf-b785-ac6a73423d5a) or [media template message](#439c926a-8a6c-4972-ab2c-d99297716da9) to your customers. |
| Media-URL | URL for the media to [download media content](#cbe5ece3-246c-48f3-b338-074187dfef66). |

## Building

### Requirements

The SDK relies on **Node.js** and **npm** (to resolve dependencies). It also requires **Typescript version 3.9+**. You can download and install Node.js and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

> **NOTE:** npm is installed by default when Node.js is installed.

### Verify Successful Installation

Run the following commands in the command prompt or shell of your choice to check if Node.js and npm are successfully installed:

* Node.js: `node --version`

* npm: `npm --version`

### Install Dependencies

- To resolve all dependencies, go to the **SDK root directory** and run the following command with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

- This will install all dependencies in the **node_modules** folder.

## Installation

The following section explains how to use the generated library in a new project.

### 1. Initialize the Node Project

- Open an IDE/text editor for JavaScript like Visual Studio Code. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.

- Click on **File** and select **Open Folder**. Select an empty folder of your project, the folder will become visible in the sidebar on the left.

![Open Folder](https://apidocs.io/illustration/typescript?step=openProject)

- To initialize the Node project, click on **Terminal** and select **New Terminal**. Execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm init --y
```

### 2. Add Dependencies to the Client Library

- The created project manages its dependencies using its `package.json` file. In order to add a dependency on the *WhatsApp Cloud APILib* client library, double click on the `package.json` file in the bar on the left and add the dependency to the package in it.

- To install the package in the project, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

### HttpClientOptions

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `timeout` | `number` | Timeout in milliseconds. |

| `retryConfig` | `Partial<RetryConfiguration>` | Configurations to retry requests. |

### RetryConfiguration

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `maxNumberOfRetries` | `number` | Maximum number of retries. <br> *Default*: `0` |
| `retryOnTimeout` | `boolean` | Whether to retry on request timeout. <br> *Default*: `true` |
