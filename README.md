# WhatsApp Bot GPT

## How it works
A conversational, voice-enabled, multilingual WhatsApp bot that can generate both text and image responses using APIMatic auto-generated SDKs for [WhatsApp](https://www.apimatic.io/apidocs/whatsapp-api/v/1_0#/http/guides/send-a-message)and [OpenAI](https://www.apimatic.io/api-docs/openai) APIs.

`Language` and `Model` are the two reserved words that the user can send to the bot for switching between desired language and AI model.
